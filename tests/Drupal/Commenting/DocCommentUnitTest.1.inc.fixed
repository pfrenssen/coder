 * Short comment with acceptable ending punctuation that does not need fixing!

/**
 * It is an unlikely comment, but question marks are acceptable, and why not?
 */

/**
 * Brackets are also an allowed ending with no warning()
 */

/**
 * This is a short comment with no full stop that can be fixed automatically.

/**
 * A comment ending in digits is fixable, but the number of these in Core is 0.
 */

/**
 * No full stop that should not be fixed, just give the error message;
 */

/**
 * This is an error that should not be fixed either-
 */

/**
 * This is the first doc comment but it spans on to a second line and adding a
 * full-stop will not fix the short comment so just report the error
